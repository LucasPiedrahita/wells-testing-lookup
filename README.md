# wells-testing-lookup
Wake County Wells testing lookup app rewritten from 3.x to 4.x ArcGIS JavaScript API.

See the live app at https://lucaspiedrahita.github.io/wells-testing-lookup/

This is a web mapping application Wake County residents can use to look up whether or not their home falls within the area that the County recommends well water quality testing.

#### If the user enters an address that is within the area, they will see this message:
Wake County has found wells in your area with unsafe levels of uranium, radon and radium in the water. This notice is to inform you about these naturally-occurring groundwater contaminants, so you can decide what actions to take to determine whether your well is impacted. If you currently pay a water bill, you may disregard this notice, because your water system is already being tested.

#### Otherwise, the user will receive this message:
Your address is outside of the area affected by this notice.
